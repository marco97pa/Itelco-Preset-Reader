## Build from source and contributing
Any contribute is accepted: there are many other useful parameters that can be found inside Itelco/Elenos preset files.  
To build from the source:
- Clone the repository
- Make your commits
- Run `build.bat`

The codebase is actually written with Windows in mind, but it can be easily compiled for Linux or other OSes since it uses only Python default libraries.
